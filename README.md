Evaluating household power consumption.

Time series data is such that a contains two main sets of information: the time and date data and the dependent variables. 
In this demonstration, I analyzed household power consumption per minute of a family across a span of 6 years. 
Exploratory analysis revealed trends in the data which was modeled using ARIMA, and I used the model to make predictions to a high accuracy. 
All the code used in the project is attached for convenience.
