In this demonstration, I analyzed household power consumption data spanning 4 years. (47 months).

the data patterns were modelled and plotted using 2d plots. 

Using the avaialable models, we can make some prediction of what the future datapoints might be. 

About Dataset

Context: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

Data Set Characteristics:
Multivariate, Time-Series

Analytical goals.: 
Regression, Clustering, visualization

Data Set Information:

This archive contains 2075259 measurements gathered between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months).
Notes:
1.(global_active_power*1000/60 - sub_metering_1 - sub_metering_2 - sub_metering_3) represents the active energy consumed every minute (in watt hour) in the household by electrical equipment not measured in sub-meterings 1, 2 and 3.


Attribute Information:
1.date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

2.time: time in format hh:mm:ss

3.global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

4.global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

5.voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

6.global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

7.sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

8.sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

9.sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
